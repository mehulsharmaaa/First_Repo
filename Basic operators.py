#SOME BASIC OPERATORS:

#ARITHEMATIC OPERATORS:
#EXPONENT:
x,y = 10,3 ;
print(x**y)

#FLOOR DIVISION:
print(x//y)

#ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
a = 3
b = 4
c = a//b
c += 1 #Basically means c = c+1
c -= 1 #Basically means c = c-1
c *= 1 #Basically means c = c*1
c /= 1 #Basically means c = c/1
c %= 1 #Basically means c = c%1
c **= 1 #Basically means c = c**1
c //= 1 #Basically means c = c//1
